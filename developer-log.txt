1.Pagination:
The API endpoint (https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products) returns only the product data without any metadata such as total item count, page number, or limit. As a result, I'm unsure how to implement proper pagination since I donâ€™t know the total number of items or how many pages there are.

2. Search Functionality:
   The API does not seem to support searching within product descriptions. Could you advise on how I might implement a search feature that includes the description field?

3. Sorting:
   Sorting by fields such as name or price in ascending or descending order is not available via the API. Would it be acceptable to implement client-side sorting using the current data loaded in the table?

4. Multiple Category Filtering:
   Currently, the API supports filtering by only one category at a time. Is there a recommended way to support filtering by multiple categories simultaneously?

I can make all thing in client side but api does not provide your requirement.
