1. https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products the api only provide only products not meta data like total count, page or limit. So, how I show pagination? I dont know total item and I dont know how many pages it have.
2. the api does not provide search with description? How how I implement search with description?
3. the api does not provide any sorting like name or price with asc and desc. Can I make the sort in client side with current table data in client side?
4. the api does not support multiple category selection filtering. You can only select one category once. How what can i do?
